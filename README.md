**Facial Expression detection using Compact Convolutional Transformer(CCT)**

**Project Overview**

This project aims to develop a facial expression detection system that classifies human facial emotions using a machine learning model. The model we implemented is based on the Compact Convolutional Transformer (CCT) architecture, which effectively combines convolutional layers for local feature extraction and transformers for capturing long-range dependencies between facial features. The primary goal of this project is to predict emotions from facial images, and the model is trained using the FER-2013 dataset.
